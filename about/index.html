<h2 id="Work-History"><a href="#Work-History" class="headerlink" title="Work History"></a>Work History</h2><p><strong>Vendr â€” Senior Software Engineer, Platform Engineering</strong><br><em>2022-2024</em></p>
<p>Vendr is a Y-Combinator Startup which helps businesses save money with SaaS procurement and negotiations.</p>
<p>As part of Vendrâ€™s platform engineering team I worked to improve developer experience and was responsible for internal tools, maintaining core infrastructure and serving as an AWS SME for engineers on other teams.</p>
<p><strong>CurrentDesk â€” Senior Software Engineer, Lead Engineer</strong><br><em>2017-2022</em></p>
<p>A CRM SaaS for Forex Brokerages integrated with trading platforms</p>
<p><strong>BlyncSync Technologies â€” Lead Developer, CTO</strong><br><em>2016-2018</em></p>
<p>BlyncSync is a startup I joined which was created by graduates of a University of Oklahoma entrepreneurship program to develop a machine learning solution for tracking truck driver fatigue through data collected by wearable smart devices.</p>
<p>Some time after launch their original technical founder left for a different venture and I was introduced to the founders by a colleague on the development team as a replacement for engineering leadership.</p>

<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>My interest in computers got started very early in the 1990s when my father replaced the Macintosh Plus in his office with a Macintosh II and left the Plus at home where he allowed me to play with it, it was the first computer I had access to and I was instantly hooked on learning more. We had a few early games for the mac like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.uvlist.net/game-211255-Hot+Air+Balloon">Hot Air Ballon</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.uvlist.net/game-210720-Tank+Commander">Tank Commander</a>. In middle school I would start using linux on my personal computer and learn XHTML and CSS from a friend during lunches initially all on paper ðŸ˜‚, Together we helped found our schoolâ€™s robotics club so we could participate in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botball">Botball</a> an educational program and competition in which students build autonomous robots programmed in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_C">Interactive-C</a> to complete a series of tasks (such as collecting objects and moving them to another location or recognizing certain color objects and sorting them) and score points within a time limit. I continued to participate in the program into highschool and have stayed in touch with the friends I made there some of whom now also went on to work in the software industry.</p>
<h2 id="Community-Work"><a href="#Community-Work" class="headerlink" title="Community Work"></a>Community Work</h2><p>While I was at Vendr I founded an LGBTQIA2S+ Employee Resource Group to connect employees for support, social activities and networking.</p>
<p>In December of 2021 I founded an online community group for transgender and gender diverse people living in Oklahoma called Oklahoma Department of Trans (a parody of the department of transportation) which hosts events and provides community and connection for hundreds of members from all across the state. Individuals looking to join may visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://odot.lgbt/">http://ODOT.LGBT</a> to apply for membership.</p>
